                Set in a dynamically evolving world, players take on the role of a leader tasked with shaping the future of their nation.
                The game offers a deep and complex political system where decisions on 
                policies, diplomacy, economics, and military strategy significantly impact the game's outcome.<br><br>

                Players must navigate through a variety of challenges, such as managing internal conflicts,
                forging alliances, and addressing economic crises. The game is designed to test strategic thinking and
                decision-making skills, providing a rich and immersive experience in political simulation.<br><br>

                Working on a major project in a professional company has allowed me to discover 
                many new things and further develop my skills. I gained experience in various areas such as
                <b>Asset Management, Tool creation, FMOD integration, ScriptableObject, Addressable, Sprite Atlas,
                    the StrangeIoC framework, working on a Multiplayer project, Server & Client communications, and AssetBundles.</b>
