            I graduated from the Department of Computer Engineering at Marmara University. 
            I have been developing games with Unity for over four years. I have gained experience both as an
            Indie Game Developer and as a Junior Game Developer in a company through the projects I have worked on.
            I have developed various types of games, including Hyper-Casual, Mid-Core, and Multiplayer games.
            Currently, I am developing new projects to learn and experiment with different aspects of game development.
